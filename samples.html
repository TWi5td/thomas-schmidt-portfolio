        <h2>Capstone Project – SCADA Simulation Platform</h2>
        <p>
            This ongoing capstone project uses Raspberry Pi units to simulate SCADA IED devices using Modbus and DNP3 protocols. It includes SD-card configuration, real-time Ethernet and serial communication, and simulation of binary and analog points. The system is intended for use with SEL RTACs and supports educational and testing scenarios.

        <h2>Rust Chess AI</h2>
        <p>
            A chess engine and GUI written in Rust using the Macroquad game framework. Features include alpha-beta pruning, quiescence search, a custom evaluation function, and a player-friendly UI. Developed as part of a programming languages course and continuously improved to simulate realistic opponent behavior.

        <h2>Mealy FSM GCD Calculator</h2>
        <p>
            A Mealy FSM implemented in Verilog to compute the GCD of two 8-bit integers using the Euclidean algorithm. Features a four-state FSM (IDLE, LOAD_A, LOAD_B, COMPUTE) and was tested in Vivado 2016.4 with pairs like (8,20)=4, (18,45)=9, and (28,49)=7. Includes a testbench and simulation results.

        <h2>4-bit LFSR with BRAM Interface</h2>
        <p>
            A 4-bit LFSR interfaced with an 8-entry BRAM, implemented in Verilog on a Zybo FPGA. Generates pseudo-random sequences stored in a circular buffer, using multi-clock domains (125 MHz and 10 MHz). Simulated in Vivado 2016.4 to verify storage after 8 cycles and overwriting after 11 cycles. Includes testbench and simulation results.
